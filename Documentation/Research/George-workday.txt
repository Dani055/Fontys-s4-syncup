7:30: Wake Up
Wake up feeling extremely tired, drink coffee to get some energy

7:40 - 8:30: Make breakfast and eat

8:30 - 9:00: Get ready for work
Check emails, check user stories and todo to create a plan of action for the day

9:00 - 10:00: Online Meetings
Update my team on what is happening with my work but I don't get a chance to talk to
them about other things unfortunately

10:00 - 12:00: Work remotely from home
While working I listen to music, read additional articles, sometimes I feel kind of lonely
because there is noone to talk to and noone to complain to when something goes wrong

12:00 - 13:00: Lunch
Mostly I eat lunch by myself at home since I don not have time to go somewhere else and eat and
my collegues are at the office.

13:00 - 15:00: More work, code reviews, documentation
By this time in the day I feel extremely tired and lacking of energy because I have not had any
interractions with others today

15:00 - 17:00: Finish up work
Make sure everything is finished for the day so I don't have to do extra work tomorrow

17:00 - 19:00: Go out to meet some friends
After work I cannot wait to go outside and meet with some people since I have not talked properly to
anyone today

19:00 - 20:00: Prepare dinner

20:00 - 21:00: Eat dinner

21:00 - 23:00: Watch netflix,relax
After a long and exhausting day I want to wind down and relax since I know tomorrow will be just as
busy and occupying

23:00: Go to sleep
I try to get at least 8 hours of sleep every day so that I feel as energized as possible in the morning
