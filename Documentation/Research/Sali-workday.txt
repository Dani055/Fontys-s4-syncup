6:30 - 7:30
Morning routine, mindfulness, breakfast, no phone. 
Get's my mood from tired to ready and enthusiastic for the day.

8:00 - 9:30 
Commute to the office (By train).
Check my goals for the day, think of some social plans for after work, start working.
 #Get my first coffee now or...

9:30 - 10:00
Daily standup with the team
 
10:00 - 13:00
Work. Still eager and willing.
 #Get my first coffee now.

13:00 - 13:45 (14:00)
Company social lunch. Very positive and inspiring atmosphere.
 #Second coffee now (if it's now its special, exotic prepared by the colleagues. Has long and complicated prep process)

14:00 - ~16:00
Work.
 #Second coffee now (machine coffee).

~16:00 - 17:00 (17:30)
Work. Already getting tired. Start checking on the social plans.

18:00 - 19:30
Commute back home.
Catch up with mundane tasks or finish up some work. More chill as already exhausted and in a pretty dark mood.

19:30 - 21:00
Train with friends. Energy levels are high again and the mood is elevated.

21:00 - 23:00
Catch up with my buddies or enjoy solitude. Have dinner.

23:00 - 24:00
Pre-bed (almost) routine. Having a hard time going to sleep.


## Slight variation in some mornings:
Wake up 8:30
Join the stand up online at 9:30
Than commute to the office while working on the train.

### 19:30 - onwards
This time is never set in stone and always varies, although 50% of the time follows the pattern above.
